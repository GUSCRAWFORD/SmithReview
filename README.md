# Introduction
An end-to-end practical example illustrating the different platforms and patterns I'm experienced with.

# Getting Started
The project requries you have Visual Studio and Node Js installed and aren't blocked from updating packages [see Alternative Source](#Alternative Source)
1.	Clone or Download source
2.  Restore NuGet Packages
3.	Build
3.	Start cmd in Ui.SmithReview and run npm update
4.  Run Webpack-Sass-Ui.SmithReview.bat in the root directory
5.  Press *Start* in Visual Studio, a local API endpoint and front-end application should launch

# Alternative Source
If you cannot restore NuGet packages or install npm packages behind your network, you can access a larger version with the necessary node_modules pre-built [here]()

# Build and Test
There are a few example tests in the test project
