# Introduction
An end-to-end practical example illustrating the different platforms and patterns I'm experienced with.

# Getting Started
The project requries you have installed Visual Studio and NodeJs (grunt-cli, karma-cli globally installed) and aren't blocked from updating packages

1.	Clone or Download source
3.	Build
3.	Start cmd in SampleReview.com and run npm update
4.  If you change any source Js, HTML or CSS, be sure to run Watch-Sass-Js.bat in the root directory
5.  Press *Start* in Visual Studio, a local API endpoint and front-end application should launch

# Build and Test

1. .NET Test Projects are runnable from the test explorer.
2. To test Js Application, run "Watch-Karma.bat" or `npm test` from a command prompt working in the SampleReview.com project directory
